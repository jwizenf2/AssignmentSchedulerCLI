# Assignment Scheduler CLI

## Who Uses It?

High school and college students who struggle with managing their workload and meeting deadlines can benefit from using this tool.

## What?
Our project deals with that issue for you by organizing your courses and workload. It will create a custom work schedule (around your class schedule) based on how hard an assignment is, when it is due, how long it will take, etc etc… 

All features will be implemented using a CLI which can eventually be turned into a GUI for better visualization 

## Why?

For students, properly planning out a working strategy to complete their school work is a very strenuous task. Each day we are plagued with making thousands upon thousands of decisions, and the order in which we do our assignments shouldn’t have to be one of them. The lack of organization often leads to handing in assignments late, unnecessary stress, and inefficient use of time.

## How/Workflow

- Input Courses and Assignments: Users can input their courses for the semester along with corresponding assignments and due dates.
- Assign Priority Levels: The system assigns priority levels to each assignment based on factors such as due date, importance, complexity, and time required.
- Display Schedule: Generates a schedule displaying assignments in order of priority.
- Customization Options: Users can customize their priority schedule by adjusting priority levels, adding new assignments, removing completed tasks, and rearranging the schedule as needed.
